# Hotel Value Analyzer

**Discover** the **ideal accommodation** with a **Review/Price** analyzer.

This application helps you identify the best value accommodations by calculating a **Review/Price Score** for each property you input.

A **higher Review/Price Score** represents exceptional valueâ€”a property that offers **high-quality experiences** (as reflected in its reviews) at a **reasonable price point**.
